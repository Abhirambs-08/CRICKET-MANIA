# CRICKET-MANIA
Cricket Mania: An advanced cricket data analysis platform leveraging PowerBI and ESPN data to enhance fantasy sports betting with in-depth player and team performance insights

 - ## ABSTRACT

Cricket, a sport followed passionately by millions around the globe, has a profound impact on both entertainment and betting industries. However, existing platforms often lack advanced analytical tools that can aid users in making informed decisions, particularly in the context of fantasy sports betting. This project, Cricket Mania, aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive cricket data analysis system utilizing PowerBI for data visualization and ESPN's data and statistics.

Our platform empowers users to create their own team of 11 players, providing in-depth performance analysis both at the individual and team levels. Through our user-friendly interface, users can compare and contrast player statistics, historical performance, and predictive analytics, facilitating more strategic decision-making for fantasy cricket and betting.

By integrating data and advanced analytics, our project not only enhances the user experience but also introduces a new dimension of data-driven decision-making in cricket betting, which is currently absent in popular apps like Dream11. This innovative approach ensures that users are equipped with the necessary insights to optimize their selections, thereby increasing their chances of success in the competitive world of fantasy cricket.

 - ## Problem Statement
   
Despite the immense popularity of fantasy cricket, current platforms like Dream11 lack advanced analytical tools that can significantly enhance users' decision-making capabilities. Fantasy sports enthusiasts need comprehensive and sophisticated data insights to make informed choices when forming their virtual teams. Existing solutions provide only basic statistics, failing to offer in-depth performance analyses and predictive metrics. This gap limits users' ability to optimize their team selections and improve their success rates in fantasy cricket and betting. Our project, Cricket Mania, aims to address this issue by developing an advanced cricket data analysis system using PowerBI and ESPN's data, offering detailed player and team performance insights to revolutionize the fantasy cricket experience.

 - ## Objectives
   
The Cricket Mania project aims to revolutionize fantasy cricket by providing users with advanced data analysis tools, enabling informed decision-making. Below are the key objectives to achieve this vision:

 - 	Data Collection using Web Scraping from ESPN: Develop and implement a web scraping framework to systematically gather comprehensive cricket data from ESPN. This includes player statistics, match details, historical performance data, and other relevant metrics necessary for in-depth analysis.
 - 	Data Filtering and Formatting: Process the raw data collected from ESPN to filter out irrelevant or redundant information. Format the data to ensure consistency and compatibility with subsequent analytical processes, preparing it for effective transformation and analysis.
 - 	Data Transformation and Cleaning: Apply data transformation techniques to restructure the data into a more usable format. Clean the data by identifying and rectifying inaccuracies, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity, thus enhancing the reliability of the analysis.
 - 	Custom DAX Queries for PowerBI: Develop and utilize custom Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries within PowerBI to perform complex calculations and derive meaningful insights from the data. These queries will enable sophisticated data manipulation and enhance the analytical capabilities of the platform.
 - 	Data Visualization and Outcome Analysis using PowerBI: Create interactive and visually compelling dashboards and reports in PowerBI. These visualizations will present the data in an easily interpretable manner, enabling users to analyze player and team performance effectively. Outcome analysis will focus on identifying patterns, trends, and actionable insights to aid users in making informed decisions for fantasy cricket and betting scenarios.
